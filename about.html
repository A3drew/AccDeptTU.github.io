        <p>While still in school, several of our students pass professional exams such as the ICAN-ATS, ICAN Professional, and ACCA.

The Accounting Laboratory, which is equipped with over 100 personal computers, latest accounting software, and statistical software packages, ensures that our graduates will remain competitive and professional leaders. This one-of-a-kind arrangement has resulted in a healthy and vigorous "marriage" of modern information technology with accounting, as it is currently practised in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and elsewhere. Students gain practical experience with several accounting and statistical research software in the Department of Accounting Laboratory.</p>
        <br>
        <p>On July 1, 2022, the Department of Accounting was established as a sub-unit inside the Faculty of Business Studies, with just 136 students and 5 academic staff. The academic staff were all professionally qualified, with one Professor of Accounting who is a Chartered Accountant. Since then, the staff's standing has improved. Students also gain practical experience in accounting businesses, consulting firms, banks, insurance companies, manufacturing enterprises, and government agencies. As of the 2022/2022 academic year, the student population has increased to 460. The Accounting Department offers a variety of courses that provide a strong grasp of the essential concepts and practises of modern accounting.
